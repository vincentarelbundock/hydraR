Description: Manage YAML configuration files in R to store, override, and
    retrieve settings such as secret keys, file paths, tuning parameters, and
    database ports. Change parameters on the fly; use placeholders for
    environment variables, external data, or complex interdependencies; and
    combine multiple config files with defaults. Includes command-line
    workflows with optional multi-run sweeps over parameter grids. Supports
    Hydra-style YAML files and resolvers.
